**League lp tracker**
THIS BOT IS IN FRENCH ONLY FOR NOW
League lp tracker is a way for groups of friends or communities to keep track of their peers' journeys through league of legends' ranked season. It is a discord bot that can be added to your own server and that is easy to setup. You can add a list of accounts to track, and the bot will post a message everytime one of these accounts win or lose a game, showing details about the last game. Every 24h, an update is made on every account's progression over the last day.

The process is simple : at initialization, the ranked data from every account is retrieved from the league api. Then, every x minutes, a refresh is made (only on "active" accounts, ie accounts on discord servers that have been initialized) and new ranked data from every active account is retrieved to check if the w/r ratio has changed. If it did, the data is processed into different printing methods, and a new request is made to the matchs api in order to retrieve the account's last game's details. On every refresh, a request to the spectator api is made for every account to check if a player is in game. If he is, the bot sends a message saying that player is in game. Fun features are also part of the bot, such as !leaderboard command, that shows a leaderboard of accounts tracked, warnings for demotion games, etc.
For now, due to the limiting number of requests authorized, a refresh is made every 2 minutes, to ensure that 20 accounts can be tracked on at least 3 different servers.
